            <p class="">
                Currently the bot is capable of interacting with the <strong>Kubernetes API</strong> to perform CRUD
                operations. The next
                step is to achieve <a href="https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii" class="text-skippo_purple">Firefly
                III</a> integration to manage personal
                finances. The bot also
                features a builtin <strong>NLP model</strong> to ensure natural bidirectional communication
