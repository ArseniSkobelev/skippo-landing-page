            <h3 class="text-2xl">What can the bot do?</h3>
            <p class="">
                Currently the bot is capable of interacting with the <strong>Kubernetes API</strong> to perform CRUD
                operations. The next
                step is to achieve <a href="https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii" class="text-skippo_purple">Firefly
                III</a> integration to manage personal
                finances. The bot also
                features a builtin <strong>NLP model</strong> to ensure natural bidirectional communication. <br>The
                main features and integrations are as following:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
                <li><strong>Kubernetes API</strong> integration</li>
                <li><strong>NLP chat model</strong> for simple bidirectional communication <i>(under construction ðŸ”¨)</i>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Firefly III</strong> integration <i>(under construction ðŸ”¨)</i></li>
                <li><strong>Mood tracking</strong> system <i>(under construction ðŸ”¨)</i></li>
                <li><strong>Reminder system </strong> <i>(under construction ðŸ”¨)</i></li>
